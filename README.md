Coding is not second nature to me and sometimes i have a hard time understanding many of the topics. this exercise is just for myself, going to try to be as thorough with the commenting and really work on just fully understanding blocks, procs, and monkey patching for these enumerables. If someone happens to come across this and this helps their learning process then awesome.
